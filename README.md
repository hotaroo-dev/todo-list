## Get started

Install the Dependency:

```shell
npm i

<br/>
```

## After that you can deploy smart contract locally using [Truffle](https://archive.trufflesuite.com/) and [Ganache](https://archive.trufflesuite.com/ganache/)

Install Truffle and Ganache

```shell
npm i -g truffle
truffle version
```

Once it is done, you can go to [tufflesuite.com/ganache](https://archive.trufflesuite.com/ganache/) to install ganache.

Now that we have Truffle and Ganache installed, we can start deploy a TodoList contract start by change to smart-contracts directory.

```shell
cd smart-contracts
```

<br/>

## Compiling and deploy a smart contract in Truffle

To compile the contracts, we use the command below

```shell
truffle compile
```

And to deploy the contract to Ganache, we use the command

```shell
truffle migrate
```

Make sure Ganache is open and running. As this is our first migration, Truffle will deploy both contracts:¬†*Migrations*¬†and¬†*Storage*.

</p>

If everything went well, we can make sure in Ganache that the contract has been sent to the blockchain.

On Ganache, select the Contracts tab and link Truffle projects to view useful data such as contracts and stored data

<div style="display: flex;">
  <img width="600px" src="public/ganache-contracts.jpg" />
  <img width="600px" src="public/ganache-project.jpg" />
</div>

Here what it shows

</p>

You can get contract address here as it will be use to connect from front-end

</p>

Now that we have deploy and get contract address we can go back from smart-contracts directory and go to libs/constants.ts to set a contract address

```typescript
// constants.ts
import TodoList from "@/smart-contract/build/contracts/TodoList.json";

export const contractAddress = "0x3F2C6Db0b13a119eDA82bAbE18cBd68FbAaE10c3";
export const contractAbi = TodoList.abi;
```

After that we can save and run the project locally

```shell
npm run dev
```

**WE DONE!**

## One last thing

We can import an account from Ganache and use it for testing purposes.
