## Get started

Install the Dependency:

```shell
npm i
```

## After that you can deploy smart contract locally using [Truffle](https://archive.trufflesuite.com/) and [Ganache](https://archive.trufflesuite.com/ganache/)

Install Truffle and Ganache

```shell
npm i -g truffle
truffle version
```

Once it is done, you can go to [[trufflesuite.com/ganache/](http://trufflesuite.com/ganache/),](https://archive.trufflesuite.com/ganache/) to install Ganache

Now that we have Truffle and Ganache installed, we can start deploy a TodoList contract start by change to smart-contracts directory.

```shell
cd smart-contracts
```

## Compiling and deploy a smart contract in Truffle

To compile the contracts, we use the command below

```shell
truffle compile
```

And to deploy the contract to Ganache, we use the command

```shell
truffle migrate
```

Make sure Ganache is open and running. As this is our first migration, Truffle will deploy both contracts:¬†*Migrations*¬†and¬†*Storage*.

</p>

If everything went well, we can make sure in Ganache that the contract has been sent to the blockchain.

</p>

After you can select contracts tab on ganache and link truffle projects as it will show useful data such as contracts and data it stores

<div style="display: flex; gap: 16px">
  <img src="public/ganache-contracts.jpg" />
  <img src="public/ganache-contracts.jpg" />
</div>

Here what it shows

</p>

You can contract address here as it will be use to connect from front-end

Now that we have deploy and get contract address we can go back from smart-contracts directory and go to libs/constants.ts to set a contract address

```typescript
// constants.ts
import TodoList from "@/smart-contract/build/contracts/TodoList.json";

export const contractAddress = "0x3F2C6Db0b13a119eDA82bAbE18cBd68FbAaE10c3";
export const contractAbi = TodoList.abi;
```

After that we can save and run the project locally

```shell
npm run dev
```

**WE DONE!**

## One last thing

We can import an account from Ganache and use it for testing purposes.
